<!-- already possible to scroll horizontally with holding shift + mousewheelscroll but we want it without holding shift, for that we need a directive seen here: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-horizontal-scroll-with-mousewheel-directive?file=src%2Fapp%2Fhorizontal-scroll.directive.ts -->
<section appHorizontalScroll>
    <app-first></app-first>
    <app-second></app-second>
    <app-third></app-third>
